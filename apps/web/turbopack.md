# Turbopack Configuration

# This file configures Turbopack-specific settings for the Fresh application

# Turbopack is enabled via the --turbo flag in package.json scripts

# No additional configuration file is needed for basic Turbopack usage

# For advanced configuration (if needed in the future):

# - Create turbo.json for monorepo task optimization

# - Configure turbopack options in next.config.js

# - Set up custom loaders or transforms as needed

# Current setup:

# - Turbopack enabled for development builds

# - Faster hot reloads and incremental compilation

# - Improved development experience with instant updates

# - Legacy webpack mode available as fallback

# Performance improvements expected:

# - 10x faster initial builds

# - Instant hot reloads

# - Better memory usage

# - Faster dependency updates
